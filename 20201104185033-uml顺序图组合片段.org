| Operator | Fragment Typ                                                                                  |
| alt      | 可选多个片段: only the one whose condition is true will execute                               |
| opt      | Optional: 片段仅在条件为真时执行                                                              |
| par      | Parallel: each fragment is run in parallel                                                    |
| loop     | Loop: the fragment may execute multiple times, and the guard indicates the basis of iteration |
| region   | Critical region: the fragment can have only one thread executing it at once                   |
| neg      | Negative: the fragment shows an invalid interaction                                           |
| ref      | Reference: 引用别的图定义的交互过程。你可以定义参数和返回值。                                 |
| sd       | Sequence diagram: used to surround an entire sequence diagram.                                |

Note That:

    It is possible to combine frames in order to capture, e.g., loops or branches.
    Combined fragment keywords: alt, opt, break, par, seq, strict, neg, critical, ignore, consider, assert and loop.
    Constraints are usually used to show timing constraints on messages. They can apply to the timing of one message or intervals between messages.
