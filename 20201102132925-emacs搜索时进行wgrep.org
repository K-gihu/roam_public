These keybindings are available while a search is active:

| Keybind   | Description                                   |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------|
| =C-c C-o= | Open a buffer with your search results        |
| =C-c C-e= | Open a writable buffer of your search results |
| =C-SPC=   | Preview the current candidate                 |
| =C-RET=   | Open the selected candidate in other-window   |

Changes to the resulting wgrep buffer (opened by =C-c C-e=) can be committed
with =C-c C-c= and aborted with =C-c C-k= (alternatively =ZZ= and =ZQ=, for evil
users).
